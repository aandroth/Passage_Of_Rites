Gameplay is four rites of passage where kobold youth pass trials to become adults

0: Title Scene

It can successfully call the AWS to make a server, and connect to that server!

Backend
///////////////////////////////////////////

Need to write Lambda fn to kill server when no players for one minute or game ends
	Access by server through API Gateway
	Lambda Fn
		Gets the arn of the container
			How to get this? Maybe save arn or other identifier to container (in the javascript of the backend itself)? Set an environment variable?
		Runs the StopTaskCommand w/ the container arn as a target

	Maybe I can just use clearInterval(refreshIntervalId);
		Let the program exit, and then that will kill the task as well?
